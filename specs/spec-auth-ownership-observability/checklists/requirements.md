# Specification Quality Checklist: Foundational Authentication, Ownership, and Observability

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-13
**Feature**: ../spec.md

## Content Quality

- [ ] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [ ] Focused on user value and business needs
- [ ] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [ ] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [ ] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [ ] Success criteria are measurable
- [ ] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [ ] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [ ] Edge cases are identified
- [ ] Scope is clearly bounded
- [ ] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [ ] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [ ] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [ ] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [ ] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`

## Validation Results (2025-10-13)

- Content Quality:
  - No implementation details: FAIL (intentional exception) — scope explicitly requires platform mentions (Secret Manager and Cloud Run) and OpenAPI documentation.
  - Focus on user value: PASS
  - Written for non-technical stakeholders: PASS (high-level outcomes with limited technical terms)
  - Mandatory sections completed: PASS

- Requirement Completeness:
  - No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain: PASS — resolved by decisions: FR-005 (username + password), FR-006 (24h absolute, 60m idle), FR-031 (`X-Request-Id`).
  - Requirements testable and unambiguous: PASS (acceptance criteria provided per requirement)
  - Success criteria measurable and technology-agnostic: PASS
  - Acceptance scenarios defined: PASS
  - Edge cases identified: PASS
  - Scope bounded with out-of-scope: PASS
  - Dependencies/assumptions identified: PASS

- Feature Readiness:
  - Acceptance criteria coverage: PASS
  - Primary flows covered: PASS
  - Meets measurable outcomes (upon implementation): PASS
  - No implementation detail leakage: FAIL (acceptable exception per scope; see above)
