# Implementation Plan (Filled): Week 8 – Identity Platform, Roles & Production Hardening

**Branch**: `008-identity-roles-hardening` | **Date**: 2025-10-21 | **Spec**: specs/008-identity-platform/spec.md

## Summary

Integrate Identity Platform with role-based authorization and production hardening, preserving the BFF pattern. Enforce CSRF on writes, validate inputs (≤1MB), rate-limit writes (10/min/user), standardize error envelopes, emit audit logs, propagate request-id/traceparent, add `/health`, and update OpenAPI. Evidence per PR aligns to Week-8 workbook.

### Environment & Flags

| Key | Scope | Required | Notes |
|-----|------|----------|-------|
| NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL | FE | ✅ | CORS allowlist target |
| FIREBASE_API_KEY, AUTH_DOMAIN, PROJECT_ID, etc. | FE | ✅ | Client SDK config |
| FIREBASE_ADMIN_* (from Secret Manager) | BFF/API | ✅ | Verification keys; not in repo |
| READ_ONLY | API | ⛔/✅ | `true` forces 503 on writes (rollback) |
| IDENTITY_ENABLED | FE/BFF | ⛔/✅ | `false` hides mutation UI, disables cookie issuing |

## Technical Context

Language: TypeScript (strict), Node 20.x. Projects: `frontend-next` (Next.js) and `api` (Node). Client auth via Firebase Web SDK; server verification via Firebase Admin. Validation via Zod. Contracts validated with Spectral. A11y via Playwright+axe/pa11y. Latency micro-bench via k6.

## Pull Request Plan (Week-8 mapped)

### PR 1: Client Integration & BFF Handlers (Day 2)
Goal: Allow users to sign in/out, with BFF verifying identity tokens; UI is auth-aware.

Scope:
- Add Firebase Client SDK; implement `lib/auth` exposing `signIn(email,pw)`, `signOut()`, `getIdToken(forceRefresh?)`.
- Implement `/api/login`, `/api/logout`, `/api/posts/*` route handlers: verify ID tokens, forward `x-user-id`/`x-user-role`, set CSRF token; optional HttpOnly cookie (15–30m) with rotation.
- Update UI: login form (labels, focus, aria-live); show/hide mutate controls by auth state; SSR reads public.
- CORS restricted to NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL; allow Authorization, X-CSRF-Token, X-Request-Id, Content-Type; methods GET/POST/PUT/DELETE; credentials true if cookie mode.

Evidence:
- Upload `a11y-frontend-next/<commit-sha>/index.html` for login flow; screenshots as needed.

### PR 2: API Hardening & Authorization (Day 3)
Goal: API enforces auth, roles, and hardening rules.

Scope:
- Middleware: identity verification (cookie or bearer) → attach `userId`, `role`.
- Guards: owner mutates own posts; admin mutates any.
- Validation: Zod schemas; body limit 1MB; return `422` envelope.
- Rate-limit: 10 writes/min/user; headers `X-RateLimit-Limit`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining`, `Retry-After`; admin not exempt.
- Audit logging for create/update/delete.
- OpenAPI: add Bearer scheme; mark protected ops; include `401/403/422/429/413/503`.

Evidence:
- Update contracts under `specs/008-identity-platform/contracts/`; Spectral 0 errors.
* ✅ Contract tests pass for **200/401/403/404/422/429** and **413/503** with standardized envelopes.

### PR 3: Observability & Documentation (Day 4)
Goal: Make system observable and update docs.

Scope:
- Propagate `x-request-id` and W3C `traceparent`/`tracestate` across tiers.
- Implement `/health` (status, commit, deps, RFC3339 time, optionally `uptime_s`).
- README: Authentication section + troubleshooting (clock skew, revoked tokens, CORS 401/403, 429 backoff).
- CI: add non-gating latency micro-bench (k6) 100 GETs + 20 writes @ c=5; print p50/p95.

Evidence:
- CI job summary shows latency snapshot table; raw CSV archived in Packet.

### PR 4: Final Evidence & Release (Day 5)
Goal: Consolidate evidence and publish v8.0.0.

Scope:
- Ensure artifacts complete (a11y HTML, coverage, Spectral report, contracts, screenshots); Gate summary surfaces all.
- Tag `v8.0.0` and publish GitHub Release linking spec PR, Linear, Gate, Packet, Cloud Run URLs.

Evidence:
- Published GitHub Release `v8.0.0` with links to all evidence.

## PR 1: Client Integration & BFF Handlers (Day 2)

**Title:** `[Day2][Client+BFF] Firebase Auth, auth-aware UI, and route handlers`

**Goal**
Allow users to sign in/out; BFF (Next.js route handlers) verifies ID tokens; UI reacts to auth state.

**Scope**
Frontend‑next and BFF only.

* **Auth client**: Integrate Firebase Web SDK (Email/Password), add `auth.ts` with `signIn(email,pw)`, `signOut()`, `getIdToken(forceRefresh?)`.
* **Route handlers**: `/api/login`, `/api/logout`, `/api/posts/*` — verify ID token with Firebase Admin SDK; if cookie mode is enabled, set **HttpOnly session cookie** with: `Secure`, `SameSite=Strict`, `Path=/`, `Max-Age=1800`; rotate every 15m.
* **Headers/propagation**: generate/forward `x-request-id` from client to handlers.
* **CSRF client hook**: prepare double‑submit token on writes (header `X-CSRF-Token`), wiring only (server enforcement lands in PR2).
* **UI**: Accessible login/logout form and auth‑aware controls (hide create/edit/delete when signed out). SSR reads remain public.
* **CORS**: Allow only `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` origin; allow headers `Authorization, X-CSRF-Token, X-Request-Id, Content-Type`; methods `GET,POST,PUT,DELETE`; credentials `true` (if cookie mode).

Out of scope:
- Any API middleware/guards/validation/rate-limit/audit changes
- OpenAPI/contract edits (those land in PR 2)

**Files (indicative)**
`apps/frontend-next/`

* `lib/auth/auth.ts`
* `app/login/page.tsx`, `components/LoginForm.tsx`
* `middleware/requestId.ts`
* `app/api/login/route.ts`, `app/api/logout/route.ts`
* `app/api/posts/[...proxy]/route.ts` (BFF proxy + verification)
* `next.config.js` (CORS), `env.example` (Firebase config)
* `tests/a11y/login.spec.ts` (+ axe/pa11y setup)

**Evidence (required to merge)**

* ✅ Upload **`a11y-frontend-next/index.html`** (or `a11y-frontend-next/<commit-sha>/index.html`) showing the login flow passes: labeled inputs, keyboard path, focus management, `aria-live` for status.
* ✅ Screenshots: signed‑out UI (no mutation controls) and signed‑in UI (controls visible per role placeholder).
* ✅ Login form uses `aria-live="polite"` for non-critical auth status; focus moves to the first invalid field on validation error.

**Merge Gates**

* Unit/UI smoke tests green.
* Login/logout manual flow recording attached.
* No secret material committed (Firebase via Secret Manager or env at deploy).
* CORS allowlist present and restricted.

**Reviewer Checklist**

* [ ] Auth module avoids logging PII/tokens.
* [ ] Cookie flags: HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Strict, Max‑Age=1800 (if cookie mode).
* [ ] Session cookie rotates at ~15m (or on role change); verify via Set-Cookie headers in test run.
* [ ] Request‑id generated when missing and forwarded.
* [ ] On 401 due to token expiry/clock skew, a single `getIdToken(true)` refresh is attempted; otherwise re-auth is prompted.
* [ ] a11y report attached and free of critical issues.

**Risks / Rollback**

* If verification fails: disable BFF cookie issuing and keep read‑only UI. Feature flag: `IDENTITY_ENABLED=false` hides mutation controls.

**Acceptance Tests**

* Anonymous browse shows no mutation controls.
* Auth user can sign in/out; UI updates; BFF receives/verifies token (assert via handler logs).
* Force expired token → first request 401 → client performs a single `getIdToken(true)` refresh → retry succeeds; otherwise re-auth prompt.
* Keyboard-only path: login → posts → create/delete → logout (no traps; visible focus).

## PR 2: API Hardening & Authorization (Day 3)

**Title:** `[Day3][API] AuthZ guards, validation, rate-limit, audit logging`

**Goal**
API enforces verified identity, owner/admin roles, and production hardening rules.

**Scope**
API service only.

* **Middleware**: verify bearer/cookie; attach `userId`, `role` to request context.
* **Ownership & roles**: `owner` can mutate own posts; `admin` can mutate any.
* **Validation**: Zod schemas; return `422 { code, message, details[] }`.
* **Limits**: 1MB body size → `413`; handler timeout 10s → structured error.
* **Rate‑limit**: in‑memory fixed window 60s, capacity 10; key `userId` or IP fallback; respond `429` with headers `X-RateLimit-Limit`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining`, `Retry-After`.
* **CSRF**: enforce on `POST/PUT/DELETE` (`X-CSRF-Token` double‑submit) → `403` on fail.
* **Audit logs**: `{ ts, userId, role, verb, targetType:"post", targetId, status, traceId }`.

**Files (indicative)**
`apps/api/`

* `middleware/auth.ts`, `middleware/csrf.ts`, `middleware/rateLimit.ts`
* `routes/posts/*.ts` (guards & ownership checks)
* `schemas/post.ts` (Zod)
* `logging/audit.ts`
* `config/security.ts` (size limit, timeouts)
* **Contracts**: `contracts/openapi.yaml` updates (Bearer scheme; protected ops; responses 401/403/422/429/413/503)
* **Tests**: `tests/contracts/*.spec.ts` (200/401/403/404/422/429/413), ownership/role tests
* Canonical: `specs/008-identity-platform/contracts/openapi.yaml` → copied to `apps/api` at build time.
* `scripts/sync-openapi.ts` (CI step): copies canonical contract into `apps/api` at build.

**Evidence (required to merge)**

* ✅ `contracts/openapi.yaml` updated with securitySchemes and per‑op `security`, plus `Err401, Err403, Err422, Err429, Err413, Err503`.
* ✅ Contract tests pass for **200/401/403/404/422/429** **and** **413/503** with standardized envelopes.
* ✅ Spectral report (ruleset pinned: stoplight/spectral:6.11.0) in `specs/008-identity-platform/contracts/` with **errors=0**.
* ✅ CSRF test: missing/invalid `X-CSRF-Token` on POST → 403 with standard envelope; valid token → 2xx.

**Merge Gates**

* Coverage ≥ **API 80% lines / 70% branches** (scope of touched packages).
* Rate‑limit headers present on **429 and non-429** responses for visibility (`X-RateLimit-Limit: 10`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining: <int>`, and on 429 `Retry-After: <seconds>`).
* CSRF enforced on writes; anonymous writes impossible.
* Logging policy enforced: do not log emails, tokens, cookies, request bodies; only `userId` (opaque UID) + `role`.

**Reviewer Checklist**

* [ ] Owner check strictly `authorId === userId`.
* [ ] `admin` path can mutate any post and is audited.
* [ ] All protected ops return standardized envelopes.
* [ ] OpenAPI operationIds unique; tags set; 401/403/422/429/413/503 present.
* [ ] OpenAPI has no global `security` (public reads). Per-operation `security` is present on protected ops only.

**Risks / Rollback**

* If verification/role source unavailable, enable **read‑only mode** (feature flag `READ_ONLY=true`):
  - All writes → `503 { code:"READ_ONLY" }`
  - AuthZ failures (insufficient role) → `403`
  - Unauthenticated → `401`

Out of scope:
- Frontend UI/BFF logic changes (beyond test stubs)
- CORS or cookie wiring in the frontend

**Acceptance Tests**

* Owner cannot edit others’ posts → `403`.
* Admin can edit any post → `200/204`.
* Invalid payload → `422` with details.
* > 10 writes/min/user → `429` with `Retry-After`.
* Expired/near-expiry token with ±5m clock skew → accepted if within tolerance; outside → 401.
* Revoked token (admin) → 401/403 per revocation check; audit shows failed attempt.
* Anonymous writes (if any endpoint exposed) use IP fallback key; sustained writes → 429 with `Retry-After`.

---

## PR 3: Observability & Documentation (Day 4)

**Title:** `[Day4][Obs+Docs] Request-id propagation, /health, README Auth, CI micro-bench`

**Goal**
System is observable end‑to‑end and docs reflect the new Auth behavior.

**Scope**

* **Tracing/IDs**: Propagate W3C `traceparent/tracestate` if present; always include `x-request-id` (generate UUID if missing). Structured logs fields: `{ ts, level, requestId, traceId, userId?, role?, method, path, status, latency_ms, msg }`.
* **Health**: `GET /health` returns `{ service, status, commit, dependencies:{firebase, db}, time }`; deep checks documented; SLO p95 < 300ms in CI smoke.
* **README**: Add **Authentication** section (how sign‑in/out works, owner/admin behaviors, troubleshooting: clock skew, token revoke, 429 backoff, CORS 401 vs 403). Add live URLs and Run & Try table.
* **Micro‑bench**: Non‑gating CI stage (e.g., `k6`) — 100 GET + 20 writes @ c=5; print p50/p95 in Gate summary; attach CSV to Packet.

**Files (indicative)**

* `apps/*/logging/*` (request/trace ids)
* `apps/api/routes/health.ts`
* `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (bench job; Gate summary renderer)
* `README.md` (Auth section + truth table)
* `packet/` (bench artifacts)

**Evidence (required to merge)**

* ✅ **CI job summary** shows a latency mini-table with columns: OP | N | CONCURRENCY | P50(ms) | P95(ms); includes rows for 100×GET and 20×WRITE; raw CSV archived in Packet.
* ✅ `/health` JSON includes `commit` (git SHA) and `dependencies:{ firebase, db }`.
* ✅ `/health` reachable in CI; output includes commit SHA and deps status.
* ✅ README updated with Auth notes, live URLs, env table.

**Merge Gates**

* Log records include `requestId` across tiers in sample flows.
* Health endpoint returns `200` and includes required fields.
* Bench artifacts attached to Packet.

**Reviewer Checklist**

* [ ] No sensitive payload data in logs; redaction filter in place.
* [ ] README “Authentication” is accurate and references spec.
* [ ] Gate summary renders the latency table.

**Risks / Rollback**

* If health/bench destabilizes CI, mark the bench job non‑blocking (already non‑gating) and open follow‑up LINEAR task.

**Acceptance Tests**

* Request traversals show constant `x-request-id`/`traceparent`.
* `/health` JSON schema matches spec and includes commit.
* `/health` matches: `{ service:"api", status:"ok", commit:"<sha>", dependencies:{ firebase:"ok", db:"ok" }, time:"<RFC3339>" }`.
