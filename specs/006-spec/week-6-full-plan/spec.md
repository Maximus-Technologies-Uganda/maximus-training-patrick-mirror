## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a mentor/reviewer and as the developer (Patrick), I need the `frontend-next` app to be first-class in CI (Quality Gate + Review Packet), deployed live on Cloud Run with SSR, with basic a11y and client contract evidence, and with governance clean and release tagged, so Week 6 can be confidently signed off.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. Gate & Packet visibility
   - **Given** a push to `main` triggers the Review Packet and Gate workflows, **When** the run completes, **Then** the job summary shows a distinct `frontend-next` block with coverage totals parsed from its coverage summary, **And** the Packet lists an artifact named `coverage-frontend-next` plus Playwright/JSDOM outputs for `frontend-next`.
2. Cloud Run demo works end-to-end
   - **Given** the Next.js app is built in standalone mode and deployed to Cloud Run, **When** I visit the Cloud Run URL at `/posts`, **Then** real data renders (not stuck on "Loading"), **And** the README contains the working URL and a "Run & Try (Next.js)" section with an env table including `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` for local and prod.
3. A11y smokes
   - **Given** Playwright runs a11y smokes per page, **Then** at least one visible control is labeled, keyboard-only navigation can trigger the primary action, and status messages are announced via `aria-live` or `role="status"`, **And** the HTML report is uploaded to the Packet.
4. Client contract checks
   - **Given** contract checks run against the shared client types, **When** responses include fields actually used by the UI (`id`, `title`, `body`, `timestamps`), **Then** checks pass, **And** when the API returns an error (400/404) in the agreed envelope, **Then** the error-path check passes; short summaries appear in the job summary and are bundled in the Packet.
5. Governance & release
   - **Given** enforcement runs in the private repo and the mirror is publish-only, **When** workflows execute, **Then** the Actions dashboard shows no failing/legacy jobs, **And** a tag `v6.0.0` exists with release notes linking this spec, the Linear issue, the Gate run, the Packet, and the Cloud Run URL.

### Edge Cases
- Misconfigured `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` yields failed fetches or mixed-content errors; prefer server Route Handlers for service-to-service calls.
- Cloud Run cold starts slow the demo; set `min-instances` to avoid demo latency.
- Coverage file path/name drift causes missing totals; the Gate should fail with a clear message.
- Mirror accidentally runs checks; ensure workflow filters/permissions so mirror is publish-only.
- Headless Playwright paths differ in CI; ensure artifact globs capture reports and screenshots.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001 (Gate/Packet job)**: Add a dedicated Review Packet job for `frontend-next` that runs tests and coverage; upload a coverage artifact named exactly `coverage-frontend-next`.
- **FR-002 (Gate summary)**: Add a Quality Gate entry for `frontend-next` that reads its coverage summary and prints total Statements/Branches/Functions/Lines to the job summary as a distinct block.
- **FR-003 (Test artifacts)**: Ensure Playwright/JSDOM outputs for `frontend-next` (reports and screenshots) are uploaded with the Packet.
- **FR-004 (Main verification)**: Trigger a run on `main` and confirm the Packet contains `coverage-frontend-next` and the Gate summary shows the `frontend-next` block; run must be green.
- **FR-005 (SSR mode)**: Choose SSR on Cloud Run using Next.js standalone output; container must read `PORT` and serve the app and assets.
- **FR-006 (Runtime config)**: Production runtime must set `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` correctly for the client, or use server Route Handlers for service-to-service calls (avoid browser ‚Üí IAP/API directly).
- **FR-007 (Cloud Build ‚Üí Cloud Run)**: Build via Cloud Build and deploy to Cloud Run in a region close to the API; configure `min-instances` ‚â• 1 for demo responsiveness.
- **FR-008 (README updates)**: Update README with the working Cloud Run URL; add "Run & Try (Next.js)" and an environment table covering local and prod, including `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`.
- **FR-009 (UI screenshots)**: Capture screenshots showing Loading ‚Üí Data and include them in the Review Packet.
- **FR-010 (A11y smokes)**: Per page, verify labeled controls, keyboard-only path to primary action, and status announcements via `aria-live` or `role="status"`; upload Playwright report(s).
- **FR-011 (Client contract success)**: Validate only the fields consumed by the UI (`id`, `title`, `body`, `timestamps`) against the shared contract/types; fail CI on drift.
- **FR-012 (Client contract error)**: Include one error-path validation (e.g., 400/404 envelope) matching the client contract; fail CI on drift.
- **FR-013 (Job summaries)**: Surface short a11y and contract summaries in the job summary; ensure these artifacts land in the Packet.
- **FR-014 (Governance placement)**: Linear checks (and Spec‚ÜíLinear, if used) run in the private repo; the mirror accepts publish-only pushes and does not run PR checks.
- **FR-015 (Noise cleanup)**: Remove/disable legacy or failing workflows so the Actions dashboard is all-green on `main`.
- **FR-016 (Release tagging)**: Publish `v6.0.0` with notes linking this spec, the Linear issue, the Gate run, the Packet, and the Cloud Run demo URL.
- **FR-017 (Traceability & PR hygiene)**: Merging [SPEC] creates a Linear issue; every code PR references the Linear issue and links any spec changes; PRs remain small and auditable and include links to Gate, Packet, and the live demo.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Frontend-Next Application**: The Next.js UI whose CI, coverage, a11y, and contract evidence are required.
- **Quality Gate**: The CI step that aggregates coverage and emits per-app totals in the job summary.
- **Review Packet**: CI artifact bundle per run containing per-app coverage, Playwright reports/screenshots, contract summaries, and UI screenshots.
- **Cloud Run Service**: Deployed SSR instance of `frontend-next` built with standalone output; serves `/posts` consuming the API.
- **Runtime Configuration**: Environment variables and/or server route handlers enabling correct API access (`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`).
- **A11y Report(s)**: Playwright-generated accessibility smokes evidence.
- **Client Contract Summary**: Evidence of field-level validation for UI-used fields and one error path.
- **Governance & Release Artifacts**: Linear issue, release `v6.0.0`, and evidence links (spec, Gate, Packet, Cloud Run URL).
