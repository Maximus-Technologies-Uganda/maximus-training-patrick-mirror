### Implementation Plan — Week 6 Finishers

**Branch**: `spec/005-week-6-finishers`

**Scope (what to deliver)**
- **Quality Gate**: Single repository-wide gate that includes `frontend-next` unit/integration tests and coverage, alongside existing packages. Gate publishes a downloadable Review Packet per run with an index/manifest, a11y report, API contract report, security audit summary, governance report, and key coverage/test summaries.
 - **Live Demo & README**: Public demo deployed from the default branch; `README.md` updated with a clear "Run & Try" section (local run steps, required configuration such as the public API base URL, and the demo link).
- **Accessibility (a11y)**: CI a11y checks on `frontend-next` for the main posts list and create post form. Threshold: zero critical and zero serious violations. Failures block the gate and appear in PR checks and the Review Packet.
- **API Contract Validation**: CI validates `frontend-next` requests/responses against the OpenAPI source of truth. Any breaking mismatches fail the gate and are included in PR checks and the Review Packet.
- **Governance & Release**: Governance checklist verified (ownership, templates, protections, changelog). Final Week-6 release published with notes and links to artifacts.
- **Security Audit**: Dependency audit runs in CI on PRs and default branch. Zero high/critical issues, or time-bound, mentor-approved exceptions recorded in `SECURITY_EXCEPTIONS.md`.

**Tech stack confirmation (monorepo)**
- **Frontend**: `frontend-next` (Next.js, TypeScript, modern web tooling), unit/integration tests, e2e capability.
- **API**: `api` (Node.js + TypeScript), with OpenAPI contract in `api/openapi.json`.
- **Tooling & CI**: JavaScript/TypeScript workspace with shared linting/formatting and test runners; centralized CI to aggregate results into a single gate and Review Packet.

**Inputs, constraints, and references**
- Feature spec: `specs/005-week-6-finishers/spec.md`
- Plan: `specs/005-week-6-finishers/plan.md`
- Contract source of truth: `api/openapi.json` (optionally cross-referenced by spec contracts where applicable)
- Demo hosting: Vercel (as clarified in spec)
- Do not commit `node_modules` or coverage artifacts; generate in CI only.

### Testing Strategy

**Test types and coverage**
- **Unit/Integration (frontend-next)**: Execute on PR and default branch; report coverage to Quality Gate. Enforce baseline: statements ≥ 60%, branches ≥ 50%, functions ≥ 55%.
- **Accessibility (a11y)**: Scan home/posts list and create post form flows. Fail gate on any critical/serious violations. Include detailed report in Review Packet.
- **API Contract**: Validate `frontend-next` HTTP interactions against `api/openapi.json`. No breaking mismatches allowed. Include contract report in Review Packet.
- **E2E/Smoke (frontend-next)**: Validate primary flows (home, posts list, create post load/submit) as part of demo readiness. Results summarized in PR checks.
- **Security Audit**: Run dependency audit across all workspaces on PR and default branch; fail gate on high/critical unless an approved, time-bound exception exists and is linked.
- **Governance Checks**: Verify README "Run & Try" (includes required configuration), CHANGELOG entry, and branch protections. Publish a governance report into the Review Packet.

**Gate reporting and artifacts**
- Publish a unified PR summary with pass/fail and key metrics (tests, coverage, a11y, contract, security, governance), and explicitly reference the OpenAPI contract source of truth (e.g., `api/openapi.json`) and the demo URL.
 - Upload a Review Packet artifact with: test/coverage summaries, a11y report, contract report, security audit summary, governance report, and a top-level manifest referencing the live demo URL and the contract source of truth.
 - Ensure all gate outcomes and reasons (tests, coverage, a11y, contract, security, governance) are visible in PR checks and within the Review Packet without requiring access to external systems.

### Execution Plan (phases and deliverables)

1) Quality Gate Integration (repo-wide)
   - Aggregate test and coverage from `frontend-next` with existing packages.
   - Enforce coverage baselines for `frontend-next` and surface metrics in PR checks.
   - Emit Review Packet with manifest and reports.

2) A11y & Contract Gates (frontend-next)
   - Add CI a11y scans for posts list and create post form; fail on critical/serious.
   - Add contract validation against `api/openapi.json`; fail on breaking mismatches.
   - Include both reports in the Review Packet; ensure the PR summary references the OpenAPI contract source of truth.

3) Live Demo & README
   - Build and deploy the demo from default branch; obtain public URL.
   - Update `README.md` with a "Run & Try" section (local steps, required configuration such as the public API base URL, and the demo link).
   - Validate primary flows load and submit without errors.

4) Governance & Release
   - Confirm governance checklist; add CHANGELOG entry and protections.
   - Create and publish final Week-6 release with notes and links to artifacts.

5) Security Audit & Exceptions
   - Run dependency audit across workspaces on PR/default.
   - Remediate issues or document exceptions in `SECURITY_EXCEPTIONS.md` with mentor approval and a 90-day review. Each exception record MUST include: an owner, mitigation plan, PR-level evidence (either a Mentor review approval or an explicit "Exception Approved" comment referencing the exception), and a link in the PR to the exception entry.

### Risks, assumptions, mitigations
- **Flaky checks**: Add retry/stabilization; monitor flake rate.
- **Demo outages**: Mark risk in CI and allow documented override by maintainers.
- **Contract drift**: Fail fast and coordinate frontend + API updates.
- **Transitive vulns**: Track exceptions with owner and expiry; re-evaluate on schedule.
 - **CI time-to-feedback**: Use job parallelization, scoped a11y scans (key pages only), and dependency/build caching; prefer fail-fast reporting to keep end-to-end under 10 minutes.

### Acceptance alignment (high-level)
- Quality Gate publishes PR summary and Review Packet including all required reports and manifest.
- Demo URL available; README updated; primary flows pass.
- A11y: zero critical/serious violations; reports included.
- Contract: no breaking mismatches; report included.
- Governance checks pass and final Week-6 release published.
- Security audit: zero high/critical or approved time-bound exceptions.
 - Observability: Gate outcomes and reasons are visible in PR checks and within the Review Packet; the PR summary references the OpenAPI contract source of truth; no external systems access required.

### Template-driven artifacts (to be generated by execution template)
- `specs/005-week-6-finishers/research.md`
- `specs/005-week-6-finishers/data-model.md`
- `specs/005-week-6-finishers/contracts/` (if applicable)
- `specs/005-week-6-finishers/quickstart.md`
- `specs/005-week-6-finishers/tasks.md`

### Working agreements
- Keep scope limited to Week-6 finishers. Avoid adding new product scope.
- Keep total CI time-to-feedback under 10 minutes.
- All work happens on `spec/005-week-6-finishers` and merges via PR after gate pass.
