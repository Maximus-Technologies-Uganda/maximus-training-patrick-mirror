# Feature Specification: Week 6 Finishers (Quality Gate, Demo, A11y & Contract, Governance, Security)

**Feature Branch**: `spec/005-week-6-finishers`  
**Created**: 2025-09-29  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Act as an expert Technical Project Manager and DevOps lead.\n\nThe project involves five key finishers:\n1. Wire the `frontend-next` application into our CI Quality Gate and Review Packet.\n2. Deploy a live demo and update the README with a 'Run & Try' section.\n3. Add CI-based accessibility and API contract tests for the frontend.\n4. Verify repository governance and publish the final release.\n5. Perform a dependency audit to check for and resolve any known security vulnerabilities.\n\nDo this on a new branch."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Establish a single Quality Gate for the repository that explicitly includes `frontend-next` test and coverage results
   ‚Üí Capture outputs in a Review Packet artifact for each PR
2. Add automated accessibility and API contract checks for `frontend-next` into CI
   ‚Üí Define pass/fail thresholds and reporting in PR
3. Provide a live demo and update README with a clear "Run & Try" section
   ‚Üí Include local run steps and link to demo URL
4. Verify repository governance and publish a final Week-6 release
   ‚Üí Ensure ownership, change log, and release notes are present
5. Perform a dependency security audit across workspaces
   ‚Üí Resolve or formally document exceptions for any high/critical findings
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT outcomes are required and WHY they matter
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tool names, code structure, or pipeline YAML)
- üë• Audience: stakeholders, maintainers, release managers, and QA

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Complete for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include when relevant
- Remove sections that do not apply

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark ambiguities** with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ‚Ä¶]
2. **Do not guess** unstated policies (e.g., release versioning rules)
3. **Think like a tester**: each requirement must be verifiable from CI artifacts or the repository
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - Quality Gate thresholds
   - Demo hosting and URL ownership
   - Accessibility severity thresholds and page scope
   - API contract source of truth and version pinning
   - Governance definition of ‚Äúready for release‚Äù
   - Security exception policy and approval process

## User Scenarios & Testing (mandatory)

### Primary User Stories
- As a maintainer/reviewer, I see a unified Quality Gate on every PR that includes `frontend-next` results, with a Review Packet I can download to audit coverage, a11y, and contract status.
- As a stakeholder, I can open a live demo URL and use the app, and the repository README explains exactly how to run and try it locally.
- As QA, I rely on CI to run accessibility audits and API contract validation on the frontend; failures block merges until addressed or explicitly waived.
- As a release manager, I can verify governance readiness and publish a final Week-6 release with clear notes and artifacts.
- As a security champion, I can confirm the dependency audit shows no high/critical issues, or approved exceptions are recorded.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. Quality Gate with Review Packet
   - Given a pull request is opened or updated
   - When CI completes
   - Then the Quality Gate evaluates unit/integration tests and coverage including `frontend-next`
   - And a downloadable Review Packet is attached to the run with: test results summary, coverage summary, accessibility report, API contract report, security audit summary, governance report, and a manifest/index referencing the demo URL and the API contract source of truth
   - And a summary comment is posted on the PR with pass/fail and key metrics.

2. Live demo available and README updated
   - Given the default branch is updated
   - When the deployment job completes
   - Then a publicly reachable demo URL is produced
   - And the repository README contains a "Run & Try" section with local run steps and the demo link
   - And the demo loads successfully and renders the following primary flows without errors: home page, posts list, create post form (load and submit).

3. Accessibility checks in CI
   - Given CI runs for a PR
   - When automated a11y checks execute on defined key pages/flows
   - Then there are zero critical and zero serious violations
   - And the a11y report is included in the Review Packet
   - And failures cause the Quality Gate to fail.

4. API contract validation for the frontend
   - Given the OpenAPI specification is the contract source of truth
   - When CI validates `frontend-next`‚Äôs requests and responses against the contract
   - Then no breaking contract mismatches are reported
   - And the contract report is included in the Review Packet
   - And failures cause the Quality Gate to fail.

5. Governance and final release
   - Given the repository governance checklist is applied
   - When a release is created from the default branch
   - Then release notes are generated and published
   - And the governance checks pass (ownership, templates, protections, changelog present)
   - And the governance report is included in the Review Packet and visible in PR checks
   - And the final Week-6 release tag and notes are visible to stakeholders.

6. Dependency security audit
   - Given CI runs on the default branch and for PRs
   - When the dependency audit executes across the repository
   - Then there are zero high/critical vulnerabilities, or documented exceptions with justification and time-bound remediation
   - And the audit summary is published in CI output and included in the Review Packet
   - And failures block merges until remediated or exception-approved.

### Edge Cases
- Flaky or non-deterministic checks cause inconsistent gate outcomes ‚Üí gate includes retry logic or stabilization plan, and flake rate is monitored.
- Demo deployment is temporarily unavailable (e.g., provider outage) ‚Üí CI marks the risk and allows a documented override by maintainers.
- API contract changes land without frontend updates ‚Üí contract validation fails, requiring coordinated updates or version pinning.
- A11y scans flag dynamic content false positives ‚Üí results allow triage with documented rationale for any exceptions.
- Audit reports transitive vulnerabilities with no upstream fix ‚Üí exception process records owners and reevaluation date.

## Requirements (mandatory)

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001 Quality Gate scope**: The repository MUST have a single Quality Gate that includes `frontend-next` test results and coverage in addition to existing packages.
- **FR-002 Metrics in PR**: CI MUST post a PR summary with pass/fail and key metrics (tests, coverage, a11y, contract) and attach a Review Packet artifact containing detailed reports.
- **FR-003 Coverage baseline**: The Quality Gate MUST enforce a documented minimum coverage baseline for `frontend-next`: statements ‚â• 60%, branches ‚â• 50%, functions ‚â• 55%.
- **FR-004 Review Packet contents**: The Review Packet MUST include at minimum: test results summary, coverage summary, accessibility report, API contract validation report, security audit summary, governance report, and a top-level manifest/index that references the live demo URL and the API contract source of truth.
- **FR-005 Demo availability**: A public live demo hosted on Vercel MUST be produced on default branch updates and referenced in the README.
- **FR-006 README Run & Try**: The README MUST include a "Run & Try" section explaining how to run locally and linking the demo; it MUST mention any required configuration (e.g., public API base URL) without prescribing specific tooling.
- **FR-007 Accessibility gate**: Automated accessibility checks MUST run in CI on the main posts list and the create post form, and FAIL the gate on any critical or serious violations.
- **FR-008 API contract gate**: CI MUST validate the frontend‚Äôs API usage against the OpenAPI contract and FAIL the gate on breaking mismatches; the contract source of truth MUST be referenced in both the PR summary and the Review Packet manifest (e.g., `api/openapi.json`, `specs/002-posts-api/contracts/openapi.yml`).
- **FR-009 Governance compliance**: Before release, the repository MUST meet governance criteria: `README.md` updated, `CHANGELOG.md` has an entry, and `main` branch protections are enabled.
- **FR-010 Final release**: A final Week-6 release MUST be published with version tag and release notes summarizing changes and links to artifacts (coverage, a11y, contract, demo).
- **FR-011 Security audit**: Dependency audits MUST run in CI on PRs and default branch; there MUST be zero high/critical vulnerabilities or documented time-bound exceptions with owner and mitigation plan.
- **FR-012 Exception log**: Any governance, a11y, contract, or security exceptions MUST be documented in `SECURITY_EXCEPTIONS.md`, require mentor approval, and include a 90-day review cycle; approval MUST be evidenced in the PR by either (a) at least one review approval from a Mentor, or (b) an explicit "Exception Approved" comment by a Mentor that references the exception record; the PR MUST link the relevant entry.
- **FR-013 Branching**: All work for this feature MUST be developed on a dedicated branch (`spec/005-week-6-finishers`) and merged via PR after passing the Quality Gate.
- **FR-014 Observability of gates**: Gate outcomes and reasons (tests, coverage, a11y, contract, security, governance) MUST be visible in PR checks and within the Review Packet without requiring access to external systems.
- **FR-015 Time-to-feedback**: The end-to-end CI for the Quality Gate SHOULD complete in under 10 minutes to support contributor productivity, measured from CI start to gate decision as surfaced in PR checks.

### Key Entities (include if feature involves data)
- **Quality Gate**: The policy defining mandatory checks and pass/fail criteria for PRs.
- **Review Packet**: A collected set of human-readable reports for a given run: test results, coverage, a11y report, API contract report, security audit summary, governance report, and a top-level manifest/index with the demo URL and contract source-of-truth reference.
- **Governance Checklist**: The set of repository readiness items required before releasing (ownership, templates, protections, changelog, release notes).
- **Exception Record**: A documented waiver capturing context, owner, justification, severity, and an expiry/review date.
