# ‚ö†Ô∏è Admin Action Required via Console

## Current Situation

Your account (`patrick.zizinga@maximusglobal.net`) doesn't have permission to modify service account IAM policies via the CLI. This requires the **Service Account Admin** role.

However, you can still complete this using the **Google Cloud Console**, which often has more granular permission controls.

---

## ‚úÖ Solution: Add Permission via Console

### Step-by-Step Instructions (1-2 minutes):

1. **Go to IAM & Admin ‚Üí Service Accounts**:
   - Direct link: https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts?project=proj-app-dev

2. **Find and click** on the service account:
   - `github-actions-deployer@proj-app-dev.iam.gserviceaccount.com`

3. **Click on the "PERMISSIONS" tab** (at the top of the page)

4. **Click "+ GRANT ACCESS"** button

5. **Fill in the form**:
   - **New principals**: `github-actions-deployer@proj-app-dev.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
     - (Yes, you're granting the service account permission to itself - this is called "self-impersonation")
   - **Select a role**: Type "Service Account Token Creator" and select it
     - Role ID: `roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator`

6. **Click "SAVE"**

## üéØ What This Does

This grants the `github-actions-deployer` service account permission to:
- Generate short-lived access tokens for itself
- Authenticate with Google Cloud services when using Workload Identity Federation
- Push Docker images to Artifact Registry
- Deploy to Cloud Run

This is the **final missing permission** for the deployment to work!

---

## üîÑ After Adding the Permission

Once you've added the permission in the Console:

### Option 1: Re-run the Failed Workflow (Easiest)
1. Go to: https://github.com/Maximus-Technologies-Uganda/Training/actions
2. Find the failed "Deploy to Cloud Run" workflow run
3. Click **"Re-run failed jobs"**

### Option 2: Trigger a New Run
Make a small change and push:
```bash
git commit --allow-empty -m "chore: trigger deployment after IAM fix"
git push origin feat/DEV-417-update-readme-and-deploy-config
```

---

## üìã Complete Permission Summary

After this fix, `github-actions-deployer` will have all required permissions:

### ‚úÖ Already Configured:
- **Workload Identity User** (on the service account itself) - ‚úÖ Added
- **Cloud Run Admin/Developer** (project-level) - ‚úÖ Exists
- **Service Account User** (project-level) - ‚úÖ Exists
- **Artifact Registry Writer** (repository-level) - ‚úÖ Exists

### ‚è≥ Needs to be Added NOW:
- **Service Account Token Creator** (on itself for self-impersonation) - **ADD THIS**

---

## üöÄ Expected Result

Once this permission is added and the workflow is re-run, you'll see:

```
‚úÖ Checkout code
‚úÖ Authenticate to Google Cloud       ‚Üê Will now succeed!
‚úÖ Set up Cloud SDK
‚úÖ Configure Docker for Artifact Registry
‚úÖ Build and push Docker image        ‚Üê Will now succeed!
‚úÖ Deploy to Cloud Run
‚úÖ Verify deployment

üéâ Deployment Successful!
Service URL: https://maximus-training-frontend-xxxxx.a.run.app
```

---

## ‚ùì If Console Access Fails

If you also don't have permission via the Console, you'll need to contact your Google Cloud admin to:

1. Grant you the **Service Account Admin** role temporarily, OR
2. Have them add the permission directly using this command:

```bash
gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding github-actions-deployer@proj-app-dev.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
    --member="serviceAccount:github-actions-deployer@proj-app-dev.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
    --role="roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator" \
    --project=proj-app-dev
```

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è Timeline

- **Console fix**: 1-2 minutes
- **Re-run workflow**: 1 minute
- **Deployment completes**: 3-5 minutes
- **Total**: ~6 minutes to success! üéâ
