# Feature Specification: Finalize Week 5 API project

**Feature Branch**: `[003-finalize-the-week]`  
**Created**: 2025-09-22  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Finalize the Week 5 API project by completing three key tasks: 1. Add contract tests and surface the results. 2. Implement a final rate-limiting test. 3. Update the API documentation with a 'Run & Try' section and a Postman collection."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a maintainer and course reviewer, I need the Week 5 API to have visible quality signals (contract test results), validated rate-limiting behavior, and easy "Run & Try" instructions with a Postman collection, so learners and stakeholders can trust, explore, and evaluate the API quickly.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the project documentation, **When** a user follows the "Contract Tests" summary link, **Then** they can view a clear, current summary of contract test outcomes (pass/fail) for the API.
2. **Given** the API under normal operation, **When** a client exceeds the documented request rate, **Then** the API denies further requests within the active window and this behavior is verified by the final rate‚Äëlimiting test.
3. **Given** the project documentation, **When** a user opens the "Run & Try" section, **Then** they can run the API locally and exercise core endpoints with step‚Äëby‚Äëstep instructions.
4. **Given** the provided Postman collection, **When** a user imports it, **Then** they can invoke the documented endpoints without extra setup beyond what the documentation specifies.

### Edge Cases
- Contract tests have failures: the surfaced summary indicates failure and guides the user to detailed results.
- Requests at the exact boundary of the rate‚Äëlimit window behave consistently with the documented policy.
- Users in constrained/offline environments: "Run & Try" includes guidance to proceed within such limits.
- The Postman collection and the documentation remain aligned; mismatches are detectable and corrected.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: Provide contract tests that verify the API‚Äôs externally observable behavior against its specification.
- **FR-002**: Surface a human‚Äëreadable summary of contract test outcomes in a discoverable location within the project documentation.
- **FR-003**: Make the surfaced summary understandable at a glance (overall status and counts of passed/failed checks).
- **FR-004**: Include a final rate‚Äëlimiting validation scenario that demonstrates and verifies enforcement of the documented limit and window.
- **FR-005**: Document the expected rate‚Äëlimiting behavior in plain language for API consumers.
- **FR-006**: Add a "Run & Try" section that enables users to run the API locally and make example requests to core endpoints.
- **FR-007**: Provide a downloadable Postman collection that covers core endpoints with meaningful names and example requests.
- **FR-008**: Keep the documentation and Postman collection consistent with behaviors validated by the contract tests.

*Example of marking unclear requirements:*
- **FR-009**: System MUST surface contract test results via [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: preferred location not specified ‚Äî README section, docs site page, or CI badge?]
- **FR-010**: System MUST enforce the rate‚Äëlimit policy of [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: requests per window and window length not specified].
- **FR-011**: The Postman collection MUST include [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: which endpoints are considered ‚Äúcore‚Äù].
- **FR-012**: The "Run & Try" section MUST target [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: local only vs. also hosted demo].

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **API Consumer**: Person evaluating or learning the API; needs clear guidance to run and try endpoints.
- **Project Maintainer/Instructor**: Owner responsible for quality signals and student experience.
- **Contract Test Report**: Human‚Äëreadable summary communicating overall status and test result counts.
- **Rate‚ÄëLimiting Policy**: Concept defining allowable request volume and time window; behavior must be predictable at boundaries.
- **API Documentation**: Source of truth for "Run & Try", links to test results, and behavior explanations.
- **Postman Collection**: Portable definitions of endpoints used for exploration and verification by users.
