# Feature Specification: Week 7.5 Finish‑to‑Green Punch List

**Feature Branch**: `007-spec/week-7.5-finishers`  
**Created**: 2025-10-17  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: Tech Lead punch‑list to close Week 7.5 milestone (SSR first paint, frontend coverage signal, a11y and contract artifacts in review packet, reliable deploy trail and README accuracy, and a final evidence‑linked release).

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Posts load with content on first visit (Priority: P1)

On a first visit to the Posts page, a visitor sees post content immediately in the initial page render rather than a loading indicator.

**Why this priority**: Ensures a professional first impression and validates server‑side readiness of the product.

**Independent Test**: Load the Posts page in a fresh session and inspect the initial HTML; verify post titles are present and no loading indicator is visible before content.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a fresh browser session, **When** the visitor first loads the Posts page, **Then** the initial render contains visible post content and no loading indicator is shown prior to content.
2. **Given** the visitor is already browsing the site, **When** navigating client‑side to the Posts page, **Then** a transient loading state may appear only during navigation and disappears once content is ready.

### User Story 2 - Quality Gate shows non‑zero coverage (Priority: P2)

A reviewer opening the Quality Gate job summary can see a distinct coverage totals block with non‑zero values for statements and lines.

**Why this priority**: Provides a basic quality signal and regressions visibility.

**Independent Test**: Trigger CI; verify the summary includes a clearly labeled coverage totals section and that statements and lines are greater than 0%.
  - Label MUST be exactly: `Coverage Totals`
  - Example format (markdown):
    - `Statements: 65.3%`
    - `Lines: 62.0%`

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** CI has run tests for the frontend application, **When** the job summary is rendered, **Then** it includes a "Coverage Totals" block listing statements and lines with values greater than 0%.
2. **Given** the tests include at least one server‑rendered view and one server endpoint, **When** coverage is collected, **Then** those surfaces contribute to totals (not excluded).

---

### User Story 3 - Review Packet contains a11y HTML and API contract (Priority: P2)

An auditor downloads the Review Packet and can open a browsable accessibility HTML report and the current API contract file.

**Why this priority**: Enables compliance review and cross‑team alignment.

**Independent Test**: From CI artifacts, download the accessibility report and the API contract; open both locally and confirm readability and completeness.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a completed CI run for the review packet workflow, **When** artifacts are inspected, **Then** a human‑readable accessibility HTML report is present and opens in a browser without errors.
2. **Given** the same workflow, **When** artifacts are inspected, **Then** the machine‑readable API contract file is present and passes linting with no errors above the configured threshold.

---

### User Story 4 - Reliable deploy trail and accurate README links (Priority: P2)

An operator can confirm deployments are executed on each push to the default branch and see the live demo URL in the job summary, while the README links lead to working live demos.

**Why this priority**: Reduces ambiguity during review and accelerates validation.

**Independent Test**: Push to the default branch; confirm the deploy job runs, and the job summary contains links to the pipeline run and the live service. Verify README links resolve successfully.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a push to the default branch, **When** CI completes, **Then** the deploy job has executed (not skipped) and its summary contains a link to the pipeline run and the live environment URL.
2. **Given** the project README, **When** a reviewer clicks all deployment URLs, **Then** each opens a working live demo without placeholders.

---

### User Story 5 - Published evidence‑linked release (Priority: P3)

A stakeholder can view a published v7.0.x release that links directly to a green Quality Gate run, the Review Packet, the live demo, and this specification.

**Why this priority**: Provides an auditable milestone and a single source of truth for completion.

**Independent Test**: Open the release page; verify tag version, presence of evidence links, and clarity of notes.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the milestone is complete, **When** the release is published, **Then** the notes include direct links to the Quality Gate run, Review Packet, live demo, and this spec.
2. **Given** the release tag format policy, **When** the tag is created, **Then** it follows v7.0.x format and is visible to stakeholders.

---

### Edge Cases

- Empty or slow posts source results in a graceful "No posts available" state without loaders on first paint.
- Network errors on first visit show a clear, non‑technical error message with a retry path.
- Coverage collection yields zero due to misconfiguration; CI fails the job with an actionable summary.
- Accessibility scan encounters inaccessible routes; report still generates and highlights failures.
- Review Packet missing one of the artifacts; CI marks the workflow unsuccessful.
- Deploy job is conditionally skipped by filters; pipeline configuration ensures default‑branch pushes still deploy.
- Release tag already exists; process increments the patch version and updates notes accordingly.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: Initial render of the Posts page MUST include visible post content in the HTML delivered to the browser.
- **FR-002**: On first visit, a loading indicator MUST NOT appear before post content is visible.
- **FR-003**: During subsequent in‑app navigations, a transient loading state MAY appear but MUST clear when content is ready.
- **FR-004**: Test execution MUST collect coverage for the frontend application, including server‑rendered views and server endpoints.
- **FR-005**: Minimal tests MUST exist to ensure coverage is generated for at least one server‑rendered view and one server endpoint.
- **FR-006**: CI summary MUST display a distinct "Coverage Totals" block with statements and lines greater than 0%, labeled exactly `Coverage Totals` and including both metrics on separate lines.
- **FR-007**: The Review Packet workflow MUST include a browsable accessibility HTML report artifact.
- **FR-008**: The Review Packet workflow MUST include the current API contract file artifact and pass linting thresholds.
- **FR-009**: The deploy job MUST execute (not be skipped) for pushes to the default branch.
- **FR-010**: The deploy job summary MUST include links to the deployment pipeline run and the final live environment URL.
- **FR-011**: The project README MUST contain working live demo URLs with no placeholders.
- **FR-012**: A v7.0.x release MUST be published with notes linking to the green Quality Gate, Review Packet, live demo, and this spec.
- **FR-013**: All acceptance scenarios listed in this specification MUST pass.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Post**: Represents a published item in the list. Attributes: title, summary/body, published date.
- **Coverage Summary**: Aggregated metrics for statements, lines, functions, and branches.
- **Review Packet**: A collection of downloadable artifacts for auditors (accessibility report, API contract).
- **Deployment Summary**: Human‑readable summary for a deployment execution containing pipeline link and live environment URL.
- **Release**: Versioned milestone descriptor (tag name, release notes, evidence links).

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: First visit to the Posts page renders post content immediately without a loading indicator.
- **SC-002**: CI Quality Gate summary shows a distinct coverage totals block with statements and lines > 0%.
- **SC-003**: Review Packet contains a browsable accessibility report and the current API contract, both downloadable and openable by reviewers.
- **SC-004**: Deploy job executes on the latest default‑branch push and its summary displays both the pipeline run link and the live environment URL; README links work.
- **SC-005**: A v7.0.x release is published with release notes that link to the Quality Gate run, Review Packet, live demo, and this specification.

### Assumptions

- The default branch is named "main" and triggers CI/CD on push.
- The live demo runs in a stable, publicly accessible environment with a single canonical URL.
- The API contract is provided in a widely accepted machine‑readable format.
- Accessibility scanning uses an industry‑standard tool and thresholds are set to fail only critical misconfigurations in CI.
