**Created**: 2025-10-17  
**Feature**: specs/007-spec/week-7.5-finishers/spec.md

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] CHK001 Are first‑paint requirements defined for initial server render and client navigation states? [Completeness, Spec §User Story 1, §FR‑001–FR‑003]
- [ ] CHK002 Are coverage reporting requirements specified for statements and lines, including where totals must appear? [Completeness, Spec §User Story 2, §FR‑004–FR‑006]
- [ ] CHK003 Are a11y and API contract artifact requirements fully specified, including artifact names and acceptance thresholds? [Completeness, Spec §User Story 3, §FR‑007–FR‑008]
- [ ] CHK004 Are deploy‑trail requirements defined for triggering conditions and summary annotations? [Completeness, Spec §User Story 4, §FR‑009–FR‑011]
- [ ] CHK005 Are release requirements defined for versioning and evidence links? [Completeness, Spec §User Story 5, §FR‑012]

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK006 Is “no loading indicator on first visit” unambiguous for initial HTML render? [Clarity, Spec §FR‑002]
- [ ] CHK007 Is the scope “server components and route handlers” unambiguously included in coverage? [Clarity, Spec §FR‑004–FR‑005]
- [ ] CHK008 Are artifact names (`a11y-frontend-next`, `contract-api`) precisely defined? [Clarity, Spec §FR‑007–FR‑008]
- [ ] CHK009 Is the deploy job “must not be skipped on default branch” phrasing free of conditional ambiguity? [Clarity, Spec §FR‑009]
- [ ] CHK010 Are “working live demo URLs” explicitly defined as non‑placeholder, publicly reachable URLs? [Clarity, Spec §FR‑011]

## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK011 Do acceptance scenarios align with functional requirements for SSR behavior? [Consistency, Spec §User Story 1 vs §FR‑001–FR‑003]
- [ ] CHK012 Do coverage success criteria align with the Quality Gate summary requirements? [Consistency, Spec §SC‑002 vs §FR‑006]
- [ ] CHK013 Do artifact requirements align with auditability goals stated in user scenarios? [Consistency, Spec §User Story 3 vs §FR‑007–FR‑008]
- [ ] CHK014 Do deploy trail requirements align with README accuracy requirements? [Consistency, Spec §User Story 4 vs §FR‑009–FR‑011]
- [ ] CHK015 Do release requirements align with evidence link expectations in success criteria? [Consistency, Spec §User Story 5 vs §SC‑005]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality (Measurability)

- [ ] CHK016 Is “statements and lines > 0%” measurable and verifiable in the summary? [Acceptance, Spec §SC‑002]
- [ ] CHK017 Are artifact presence and lint thresholds measurable (pass/fail, named artifacts)? [Acceptance, Spec §SC‑003]
- [ ] CHK018 Is deploy job execution and summary link inclusion verifiable post‑run? [Acceptance, Spec §SC‑004]
- [ ] CHK019 Is “first visit shows content immediately” verifiable from the initial HTML? [Acceptance, Spec §SC‑001]
- [ ] CHK020 Is release publication with evidence links verifiable on the release page? [Acceptance, Spec §SC‑005]

## Scenario Coverage

- [ ] CHK021 Are zero‑state scenarios (no posts) requirements present? [Coverage, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK022 Are network error scenarios on first visit covered with user‑facing messaging? [Coverage, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK023 Are CI failure scenarios for missing artifacts/zero coverage addressed? [Coverage, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK024 Are conditional deploy skip scenarios addressed by explicit safeguards? [Coverage, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK025 Are release tag conflicts (tag exists) covered with next‑patch strategy? [Coverage, Spec §Edge Cases]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [ ] CHK026 Is the fallback message for no posts explicitly defined? [Edge Case, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK027 Is behavior defined when accessibility scan or contract lint fails? [Edge Case, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK028 Is behavior defined when coverage totals are zero due to misconfiguration? [Edge Case, Spec §Edge Cases]

## Non‑Functional Requirements

- [ ] CHK029 Are accessibility goals framed beyond artifact presence (e.g., thresholds/priority of issues)? [NFR, Spec §FR‑007, §SC‑003]
- [ ] CHK030 Are documentation updates (README accuracy) treated as verifiable requirements? [NFR, Spec §FR‑011]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [ ] CHK031 Are external API dependencies for posts documented with stable base URL assumptions? [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions]
- [ ] CHK032 Is the default branch assumption (“main”) validated or documented? [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [ ] CHK033 Are there any undefined thresholds or terms (“transient”) that should be quantified? [Ambiguity, Spec §User Story 1]
- [ ] CHK034 Do any requirements conflict between acceptance scenarios and functional requirements? [Conflict]
