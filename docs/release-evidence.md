# Release Evidence Guide

This document explains how to find and interpret the evidence generated by our CI/CD pipeline ("The Gate"). All artifacts are linked directly in the Pull Request body under "Gate Artifacts."

## Core Artifacts

### 1. Coverage (`coverage-frontend-next`)
* **Purpose:** Shows the test coverage of our frontend application.
* **How to Use:** Download the artifact and open the `index.html` file in a browser to explore the detailed coverage report. The PR Gate summary also shows the high-level percentage totals.

### 2. Accessibility (`a11y-frontend-next`)
* **Purpose:** Reports on the accessibility health of our application, based on WCAG standards.
* **How to Use:** This artifact contains both an `index.html` file for a browsable report and a `summary.json` for machine-readable results. Our Gate fails on any "critical" violations.

### 3. API Contract (`contract-api`)
* **Purpose:** Verifies that our API specification is valid and adheres to our style guide.
* **How to Use:** This contains the exact `openapi.json` file used for the check, along with a Spectral linting report. Our Gate fails on any Spectral errors.

## Finding Artifacts in Pull Requests

All evidence artifacts are uploaded during the Quality Gate CI run and are available through multiple channels:

1. **PR Body** - The "Gate Artifacts" section in each PR contains direct links to relevant artifacts
2. **GitHub Actions** - Navigate to the CI run and scroll to the "Artifacts" section at the bottom
3. **Job Summary** - The Quality Gate job summary includes rendered tables and reports with key metrics

## Interpreting Gate Results

### Coverage Thresholds
The Gate enforces per-package and diff coverage thresholds as defined in `DEVELOPMENT_RULES.md`. If coverage drops below the threshold, the Gate will fail and the PR cannot be merged.

### Accessibility Standards
We enforce WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards. Critical violations (those that prevent users from accessing content or functionality) will fail the Gate. Warnings are informational and do not block merges.

### Contract Validation
The API specification must pass Spectral linting with zero errors. This ensures:
- OpenAPI 3.1 compliance
- Consistent operation patterns
- Complete request/response schemas
- Proper authentication flows

## Local Evidence Generation

You can generate the same evidence locally before pushing:

```bash
# Coverage
cd frontend-next && pnpm run test:ci

# Accessibility
cd frontend-next && pnpm run test:e2e

# Contract validation
cd api && npx spectral lint openapi.json
```

For a complete local gate run that mirrors CI:

```bash
# From repo root
pnpm run gate:aggregate
pnpm run gate:packet -- --force
```

This will generate the full Review Packet in `docs/ReviewPacket/`.
