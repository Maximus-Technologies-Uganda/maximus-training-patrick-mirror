Thank you for contributing! Please follow these conventions to keep our workflow consistent.

## Branch Naming Convention

- Format: feature/LIN-###-short-scope
- Guidelines:
  - Replace LIN-### with the ticket ID (e.g., LIN-1234).
  - Use a concise, kebab-cased scope describing the change.
  - Use lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens only.

- Example:
  - feature/LIN-1234-auth-login

## Pull Request (PR) Title Convention

- Format: feat(scope): short description (LIN-###)
- Guidelines:
  - Use imperative mood for the short description.
  - scope is the affected area or component.
  - Include the ticket ID in parentheses at the end.

- Example:
  - feat(auth): add login with OTP (LIN-1234)
