## What Remains (Quick Wins)

### ⏳ Remaining Phase 2 Tasks

**Task: Complete pnpm setup replacements**

The following files still need pnpm setup replacements. Use the pattern below:

#### Pattern to Replace

**Old Code:**

```yaml
- name: Enable Corepack (pnpm 9)
  run: |
    corepack enable
    corepack prepare pnpm@9.x --activate
```

**New Code:**

```yaml
- uses: ./.github/actions/setup-pnpm
```

#### Files & Locations to Update

1. **quality-gate.yml**
   - `frontend-next-coverage` job: Line 171-174
   - `api-coverage` job: Line 277-280
   - `aggregate-coverage` job: (search for "Enable Corepack")
   - `review-packet.yml` jobs: Multiple locations

2. **review-packet.yml**
   - `install-root-deps` job
   - `discover` job (if present)
   - `per_app` job matrix

3. **deploy-cloud-run.yml** (if uses pnpm)

### How to Complete Remaining Phase 2 (Quick Method)

You have two options:

**Option A: Manual (10-15 minutes)**

1. Open each workflow file in your IDE
2. Search for "Enable Corepack"
3. Replace each 4-line block with `- uses: ./.github/actions/setup-pnpm`
4. Save and test

**Option B: Automated (if you're comfortable with sed)**

```bash
cd .github/workflows

# Replace all pnpm setup blocks (careful - backup first!)
for file in *.yml; do
  # Create backup
  cp "$file" "${file}.bak"

  # Replace (may need fine-tuning depending on formatting)
  sed -i '/- name: Enable Corepack.*pnpm/{N;N;N;N;N;s/.*Enable Corepack.*/      - uses: .\/.github\/actions\/setup-pnpm/;N;N;N;d}' "$file"
done
```

---

## Phase 3 & 4 Implementation Guide

### Phase 3: Medium Improvements (Ready to Implement)

These have clear, independent changes that can be added to workflows:

#### 1. Improve pnpm Cache Keys

**Add to all pnpm cache blocks:**

```yaml
- name: Resolve pnpm version
  id: pnpm-version
  shell: bash
  run: echo "version=$(pnpm -v | cut -d. -f1)" >> "$GITHUB_OUTPUT"

- name: Cache pnpm store (with fallback keys)
  uses: actions/cache@v4
  with:
    path: ${{ env.PNPM_STORE_PATH }}
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-pnpm-store-v${{ steps.pnpm-version.outputs.version }}-${{ hashFiles('**/pnpm-lock.yaml') }}
    restore-keys: |
      ${{ runner.os }}-pnpm-store-v${{ steps.pnpm-version.outputs.version }}-
      ${{ runner.os }}-pnpm-store-
```

**Files to update:**

- `quality-gate.yml` (lines: pnpm-store cache blocks)
- `ci.yml` (lines: pnpm-store cache block)
- `review-packet.yml` (lines: pnpm-store cache blocks)

#### 2. Add Build Artifact Caching

**Add to frontend-next-coverage and frontend-next-a11y jobs:**

```yaml
- name: Cache Next.js build
  uses: actions/cache@v4
  with:
    path: |
      frontend-next/.next/cache
      frontend-next/.turbo
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-nextjs-${{ github.ref }}-${{ github.sha }}
    restore-keys: |
      ${{ runner.os }}-nextjs-${{ github.ref }}-
      ${{ runner.os }}-nextjs-

- name: Cache Jest
  uses: actions/cache@v4
  with:
    path: api/.jest-cache
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-jest-${{ github.ref }}-${{ github.sha }}
    restore-keys: |
      ${{ runner.os }}-jest-${{ github.ref }}-
      ${{ runner.os }}-jest-
```

#### 3. Add ESLint Cache

**Add to quality-gate lint steps:**

```yaml
- name: Cache ESLint
  uses: actions/cache@v4
  with:
    path: .eslintcache
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-eslint-${{ github.ref }}-${{ github.sha }}
    restore-keys: |
      ${{ runner.os }}-eslint-${{ github.ref }}-
      ${{ runner.os }}-eslint-
```

#### 4. Add Conditional Execution

**Add `if` conditions to expensive jobs:**

```yaml
contract-artifact:
  if: ${{ hashFiles('api/openapi.json') != '' }}

frontend-next-a11y:
  if: ${{ hashFiles('frontend-next/tests/playwright/**/*.spec.ts') != '' }}

spectral-lint:
  if: ${{ hashFiles('specs/**/*.{yaml,yml}', 'api/openapi.json') != '' }}
```

#### 5. Clarify Deploy Dependencies

**Update deploy.yml:**

```yaml
deploy:
  needs: quality-gate
  if: ${{ github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' && success() }}
```

---

### Phase 4: Long-Term Consolidation

These are more complex and should be done after Phase 2-3 are stabilized:

#### 1. Create install-deps Composite Action

Create `.github/actions/install-deps/action.yml`:

```yaml
name: Install Dependencies
description: Install root and workspace dependencies with caching
inputs:
  workspace:
    description: Workspace to install (optional)
    required: false
    default: ''
runs:
  using: composite
  steps:
    - uses: ./.github/actions/setup-pnpm
    - name: Resolve pnpm store path
      id: pnpm-store
      shell: bash
      run: |
        echo "PNPM_STORE_PATH=$(pnpm store path)" >> "$GITHUB_ENV"
        echo "path=$(pnpm store path)" >> "$GITHUB_OUTPUT"
    - name: Cache pnpm store
      uses: actions/cache@v4
      with:
        path: ${{ env.PNPM_STORE_PATH }}
        key: ${{ runner.os }}-pnpm-store-${{ hashFiles('**/pnpm-lock.yaml') }}
        restore-keys: |
          ${{ runner.os }}-pnpm-store-
    - name: Install root
      shell: bash
      run: pnpm install --ignore-scripts --frozen-lockfile=false
    - name: Install workspace
      if: ${{ inputs.workspace != '' }}
      shell: bash
      run: |
        cd ${{ inputs.workspace }}
        pnpm install --ignore-scripts --frozen-lockfile=false
```

#### 2. Consolidate Workflows

Merge quality-gate, ci, and review-packet into a single configurable workflow using `workflow_dispatch` inputs.

#### 3. Parallelize Tests

Use matrix strategy:

```yaml
test:
  strategy:
    matrix:
      workspace: [api, frontend-next, frontend]
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - uses: ./.github/actions/install-deps
      with:
        workspace: ${{ matrix.workspace }}
    - run: npm run test:ci
      working-directory: ${{ matrix.workspace }}
```

## Testing Your Changes

### Local Validation

```bash
# 1. Verify YAML syntax
for file in .github/workflows/*.yml; do
  echo "Checking $file..."
  yamllint "$file" || true
done

# 2. Check composite actions exist
ls -la .github/actions/setup-pnpm/action.yml

# 3. Verify script is executable
ls -la scripts/check-coverage-nonzero.sh
chmod +x scripts/check-coverage-nonzero.sh
```

### CI Validation

```bash
# 1. Create test branch
git checkout -b test/optimization

# 2. Make a small change to frontend-next
echo "// test" >> frontend-next/src/test.ts

# 3. Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "test: verify optimization"
git push -u origin test/optimization

# 4. Monitor GitHub Actions
# - ci.yml should RUN (changed frontend-next)
# - Check for Playwright cache messages
# - Verify pnpm setup action works
# - Look for cache-hit: true/false

# 5. Test path filters
# Create PR changing only quote/ directory
# ci.yml should be SKIPPED (path filter)
```

### Measurement

```bash
# Track metrics after merge
gh run list --repo owner/repo \
  --workflow quality-gate.yml \
  --limit 10 \
  --json "durationMinutes,createdAt" \
  --jq '.[] | "\(.createdAt): \(.durationMinutes)m"'

# Calculate average before/after
# Target: 25-35m → 20-30m (Phase 2) → 15-25m (Phase 3-4)
```
