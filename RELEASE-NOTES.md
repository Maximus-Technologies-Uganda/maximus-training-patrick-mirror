# v6.0.0 â€“ Week 6: Finish-to-Green for frontend-next

This release makes `frontend-next` first-class in CI with evidence, deploys the SSR demo to Cloud Run, adds a11y smokes and client-side contract checks, and completes governance cleanup.

## Highlights

- Quality Gate prints `frontend-next` coverage totals in the job summary.
- Review Packet artifacts include coverage, Playwright a11y, contract summaries, and screenshots.
- Cloud Run SSR demo uses Next.js standalone output and binds to `PORT`.
- Governance tightened: Linear-only in private repo, mirror is publish-only; legacy/noisy workflows disabled.
