## Coverage Reports

Coverage HTML reports are generated by CI for each pull request. Use the link below, which resolves dynamically for the current PR in GitHub Actions:

- Coverage Index: `${{ github.server_url }}/${{ github.repository }}/pull/${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}/checks` â†’ Open the "Artifacts" for the workflow run and download "coverage-report" to view `index.html`.

If using the Coverage Gate workflow's comment, look for the coverage table posted on the PR and follow the artifact link in that comment.
