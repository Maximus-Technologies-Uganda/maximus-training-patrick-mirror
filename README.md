Monorepo containing multiple small apps and exercises (`quote/`, `expense/`, `stopwatch/`, `todo/`, `frontend/`, and more).

## Quickstart

Prerequisites:

- Node.js 18+
- Git

Install dependencies per workspace as needed, then run tests:

```bash
npm test
```

Run a subset of tests (see `scripts/run-tests.js` for available names):

```bash
npm run test -- --only quote
```

To run dev-week-1 samples:

```bash
npm run test:dev
```

## Live Preview

Deployed via GitHub Pages from `frontend/dist` on `main`.

- Live site: <INSERT_GITHUB_PAGES_URL>

## Coverage Reports

Coverage HTML reports are generated by CI for each pull request. The Coverage Index provides a comprehensive view of test coverage across all apps.

- **Coverage Index**: Access via the Review Packet workflow's artifacts. Navigate to `${{ github.server_url }}/${{ github.repository }}/pull/${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}/checks` → Artifacts → Download "coverage-report" → Open `index.html` for detailed coverage breakdowns.

For quick checks, refer to the coverage table posted by the Quality Gate workflow in PR comments.
