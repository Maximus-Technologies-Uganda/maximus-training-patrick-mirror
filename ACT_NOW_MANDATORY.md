# Act Tool Now Mandatory

**Date:** October 29, 2025
**Status:** ‚úÖ UPDATED - Act is now required for all developers

---

## Change Summary

The `act` tool for GitHub Actions simulation is **NO LONGER OPTIONAL**.

### Before

- Tier 4 (GitHub Actions simulation) was optional
- If act not installed: warning shown, push still allowed
- Developers could choose to skip this step

### After (NOW)

- Tier 4 (GitHub Actions simulation) is **MANDATORY**
- If act not installed: **push FAILS** with error
- All developers **must** install act
- **No exceptions**

---

## What This Means

### For Every Developer

```bash
$ git push

# If act is NOT installed:
‚ùå TIER 4 FAILED: act tool not found (MANDATORY)

   Install act to enable GitHub Actions simulation:

   Windows:  choco install act
   macOS:    brew install act
   Linux:    https://github.com/nektos/act/releases

   After installation, verify with: act --version
   Then try pushing again: git push
```

### What Happens Next

```bash
# 1. Install act
$ choco install act

# 2. Verify installation
$ act --version
# Example output: version "0.2.55"

# 3. Try pushing again
$ git push
# ‚Üí All tiers run (including Tier 4)
# ‚Üí If all pass ‚Üí code pushed ‚úì
# ‚Üí If any fail ‚Üí push blocked ‚ùå
```

## Error Messages & Solutions

### "act: command not found"

```bash
# Solution: Install act
choco install act  # Windows
brew install act   # macOS

# Verify:
act --version
```

### "Cannot connect to Docker daemon"

```bash
# Solution: Start Docker
# Windows/macOS: Open Docker Desktop application
# Linux: sudo systemctl start docker

# Verify:
docker ps
```

### "act: No such file or directory"

```bash
# Solution: Install act (may not be in PATH)
# Windows: choco install act
# macOS: brew install act

# Or manually add to PATH and restart terminal
```

### Push still fails after installing act

```bash
# Check act is working:
act --version

# Check Docker is running:
docker ps

# Try push again:
git push
```

## Pre-Push Hook Changes

### What Changed in `.husky/pre-push`

**Before:**

```bash
if command -v act &> /dev/null; then
  # Run act if available
  # If not found: show warning, allow push anyway
else
  echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  act tool not found. You can still push..."
fi
```

**After (NOW):**

```bash
if ! command -v act &> /dev/null; then
  echo "‚ùå TIER 4 FAILED: act tool not found (MANDATORY)"
  echo "   Install act to enable GitHub Actions simulation:"
  echo "   Windows:  choco install act"
  echo "   macOS:    brew install act"
  echo "   After installation, verify with: act --version"
  exit 1  # ‚Üê PUSH FAILS HERE
fi

# Run act (required)
if ! act -W .github/workflows/quality-gate.yml ...; then
  echo "‚ùå TIER 4 FAILED: GitHub Actions simulation had errors"
  exit 1  # ‚Üê PUSH FAILS HERE TOO
fi
```

## FAQ

**Q: Why is act mandatory now?**
A: To ensure every push is validated in the exact GitHub Actions environment. Catches edge cases that local testing might miss.

**Q: What if I don't want to install act?**
A: You must install it to push. No exceptions. It's a requirement for this project.

**Q: Can I use --no-verify to bypass this?**
A: Yes, `git push --no-verify` skips hooks. But this defeats the purpose of local validation. Not recommended.

**Q: Does act require Docker?**
A: Yes. Docker must be installed and running for act to work.

**Q: Is act free?**
A: Yes, act is completely free and open source.

**Q: How long does act take?**
A: 5-15 minutes depending on your code and machine speed.

**Q: What if act simulation fails?**
A: Push is blocked. Error shown. You must fix the issue before pushing.

**Q: Can I disable act?**
A: Only by editing `.husky/pre-push` directly. Not recommended and will break the quality gates.
